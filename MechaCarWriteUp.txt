MPG Regression

-Accoring to the linear regression model of the mechacar_mpg dataset, vehicle length and ground clearance appear to provide a non-random amount of variance to MPG. AWD was not included in this linear regression model because the value provided is a categorical true/false value, not a measured value.
-The slope is not considered to be zero because the p-value is below the .05 significance level at 2.277e11
-The multiple rsquared value is .70, which means the model will predict mpg roughly 70% of the time, making it an effective model.

Suspenion Coil Summary
Design specifications dictate a variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Overall, the lots combined are do achieve the specifications however when looked at indvidually, Lot 3 exceeds the specifications at 170 pounds per inch.

Suspenion Coil T-Test
The one sample t-test p-value for Lots 1 and 2 were above the significance level indicating they are not statiscally different form the population mean. Lot 3 however was lower at .04 indicating it is statistically different from the population.

Mecha Performance Study
-Consumers would likely be interested in cost, fuel efficiency, horsepower when considering the performance of a car. 
-One comparison to make in this determination would be the horsepower the MechaCar to other comparable vehicles. 
    The null hypothesis being there is no statistical difference in the mean horsepower of the ehicle and the alternative hypothesis being there is. 
    A one sample t-test would be the test to use to determine this. 
-We would also need to collect the horsepower data from several different vehicles manufacturers.
